2   Lost in a dream I don't know which way to go (Let me say that) If you are all that you seem Then baby, I'm movin' (movin') way too slow I've been fooled before Wouldn't like to get my love caught In the slammin' door How about some information please Straight up now tell me Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh) Or am I caught in a hit and run Straight up now tell me Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh) Or are you just having fun Time's standin' still Waiting for some small clue (Let me tell you that) I keep getting chills When I think your love is true I've been fooled before Wouldn't like to get my love caught In the slammin' door How about some information please Straight up now tell me Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh) Or am I caught in a hit and run Straight up now tell me Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh) Or are you just having fun
3   I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You're the one that was trying to keep me way down But like the sun know you know I found my way back round They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell Love yourself, girl, or nobody will Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels I feel for you Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you You wake up, put makeup on Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?" What it's like to have a crooked smile I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You're the one that was trying to keep me way down But like the sun know you know I found my way back round To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling You keep falling victim cause you're insecure And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure 'Cause he don't seem to want you back And it got you asking So all you see is what you lacking Not what you packing Take it from a man that loves what you got And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see That the hands can't touch That them broads can't be, and that's you Never let 'em see you frown And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud I can tell you ain't laughed in a while But I wanna see that crooked smile
